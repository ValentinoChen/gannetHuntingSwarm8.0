## main features in this project

Simulated sky and ocean

Whole process of gannets hunting fish

Gannets have eyesights, which will determine whether gannets hunt the fish

Gannets must breath by their lungs, so they have limited time when diving

The stomach of gannets is limited, so they have a hunting number limit

## other instructions

You can change the eyesight parameters or hunting number limit, to simulate different weather or different age of gannets

Or you can change other parameters, such as flight coefficients
